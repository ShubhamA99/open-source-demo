## üìù Overview

Open Chat Kit: School Demo App is a robust, full-stack template designed to accelerate the development of modern web applications. It provides a comprehensive starting point by integrating key technologies and best practices, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than boilerplate setup. This template is particularly well-suited for educational applications or platforms requiring user management, rich UIs, and scalable state management.

The application leverages React for a dynamic user interface, Clerk for secure authentication, Mantine for UI components, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend and deployment are containerized using Docker and Nginx, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) / [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
# or
# pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. You can copy the example from `docker-compose.yml` or the section below and populate it with your actual keys and preferences.

```env
# Required for Clerk authentication
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Optional branding and feature flags (defaults are shown if not set or different from current README)
REACT_APP_BRAND_NAME="Your App Brand Name"
REACT_APP_LOGO_URL=your_logo_url
REACT_APP_PROJECTS_LABEL="Projects"
REACT_APP_EDIT_PROJECTS_LABEL="Project"
REACT_APP_PROJECTS_ROUTE="project"
REACT_APP_ENABLE_PROJECTS=false
REACT_APP_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_LABEL="Knowledge Bases"
REACT_APP_EDIT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_LABEL="Knowledge Base"
REACT_APP_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ROUTE="knowledge"
REACT_APP_ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_BASES=false
REACT_APP_ENABLE_CHATS=false
REACT_APP_CHAT_ROUTE="c" # Ensure this matches your desired route if enabled
REACT_APP_ENABLE_HISTORY=false
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ENABLE=false
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CODE="" # Your Google Analytics G-XXXXXXXXXX code

# Add other environment variables as needed
```

**Note:** The `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is essential for authentication to work. Obtain this from your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

### 4. Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Webpack Dev Server)

This method is ideal for development as it provides hot reloading and detailed error messages.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port specified in `webpack.config.js`).

#### Production Mode (Docker)

This method builds a production-ready Docker image and runs it using Docker Compose. This is how the application would typically be deployed.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command uses the `Dockerfile` to build your application image.

    ```bash
    docker build -t open-chat-kit-school-demo .
    ```

2.  **Run using Docker Compose:**
    This command reads the `docker-compose.yml` file to configure and run your application container, including setting up environment variables and port mappings.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    Alternatively, to run in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The application will be served by Nginx and available at `http://localhost:4000` (as per `docker-compose.yml` and `nginx.conf` port configurations).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode using `webpack-dev-server`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
- `npm run analyze`: Builds the app for production and opens the webpack bundle analyzer to inspect bundle sizes.

## Dockerization Details

The project includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile`:

- **Stage 1 (Builder):**
  - Uses a `node:lts-alpine` base image.
  - Sets `NODE_OPTIONS` to increase memory for the Node.js process.
  - Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs dependencies.
  - Copies the entire application source code.
  - Runs `npm run build` to create a production build in the `/app/dist` directory.
- **Stage 2 (Serve):**
  - Uses an `nginx:stable-alpine` base image.
  - Copies the built application from the builder stage (`/app/dist`) to Nginx's webroot (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).
  - Copies a custom `nginx.conf` to configure Nginx to serve the React application, including handling client-side routing.
  - Exposes port `4000`.
  - Starts Nginx in the foreground.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the `app` service:

- Builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current context.
- Maps port `4000` of the host to port `4000` of the container.
- Defines various environment variables that are passed to the application at runtime. These are crucial for features like Clerk authentication and customizing UI labels and routes.

The `nginx.conf` file configures Nginx to:

- Listen on port `4000`.
- Serve static files from `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
- Use `try_files` to ensure that all routes are directed to `index.html`, which is necessary for single-page applications using client-side routing.

## Environment Variables Reference

The application uses the following environment variables. These can be set in a `.env` file at the project root or directly in your `docker-compose.yml` or deployment environment.
